##Overview
The **BTO Management System** is a Java console application that simulates the Build-To-Order (BTO) flat application and management process. The system supports multiple user roles—Applicant, Officer, and Manager—each with dedicated functionalities for applying, managing, and overseeing BTO projects.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login for Applicants, Officers, and Managers.
- **Applicant Portal**:  
  - View and filter available projects  
  - Apply for BTO flats  
  - Book flats upon approval  
  - Submit and view enquiries  
  - Change password  
- **Officer Portal**:  
  - Register to manage projects  
  - View and reply to applicant enquiries  
  - Approve bookings and generate receipts  
  - Change password  
- **Manager Portal**:  
  - Approve officer registrations  
  - Assign officers to projects  
  - Oversee all project and application statuses  
- **Data Persistence**: Project and user data are loaded from and saved to CSV files.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Graceful management of invalid inputs and edge cases.

## Technologies Used

- Java 23 (or compatible version)
- Standard Java libraries (`java.util`, `java.time`, etc.)
